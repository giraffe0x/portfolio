## Introduction
### Hi, I'm Nicholas 'giraffe0x' a Smart Contract Auditor and Software Engineer.

I am actively competing in contests on Sherlock, C4 and Cantina and secured top placings in multiple contests. My range of expertise spans various domains including restaking, lending/borrowing, NFT protocols and DAO governance.

As a former solidity developer at a Defi protocol, I also have experience writing test suites, fuzzing/invariant tests, and gas optimization.

I am also engaged in private audits with industry leading audit firms [@SpearbitDAO](https://twitter.com/SpearbitDAO) and [@GuardianAudits](https://twitter.com/GuardianAudits).

Major highlights:
1. 3rd placing in Code4rena contest for Salty.io (Dex with zero swap fees): [https://code4rena.com/audits/2024-01-saltyio#top](https://code4rena.com/audits/2024-01-saltyio#top)
2. 3rd placing in Sherlock contest for Jojo Exchange (Perp protocol): [https://audits.sherlock.xyz/contests/136/leaderboard](https://audits.sherlock.xyz/contests/136/leaderboard)
