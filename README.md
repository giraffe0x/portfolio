# giraffe0x - Security reviews portfolio

### Hi, I am a Security Researcher with [@GuardianAudits](https://twitter.com/GuardianAudits) doing Solidity Smart Contract audits.

I also compete on Sherlock, Code4rena and Cantina and secured top placings in multiple contests. My range of expertise includes restaking, defi lending/borrowing, NFT and DAO governance.

Previously, I was a Solidity developer at [@Steadefi](https://twitter.com/steadefi) where I built yield vaults which attracted >$2M in TVL. I have experience writing comprehensive test suites, fuzzing/invariant tests, and performing gas optimization.

I was also accepted into [@SpearbitDAO](https://twitter.com/SpearbitDAO) as a Junior Security Researcher.

Major highlights:
1. Feb 2024 - 2nd placing in Cantina contest for Opal (Yield / Balancer)
2. Jan 2024 - 3rd placing in Code4rena contest for Salty.io (Dex)
3. Jan 2024 - 3rd placing in Sherlock contest for Jojo Exchange (Perp protocol)
