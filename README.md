# giraffe0x - Security reviews portfolio

### Hi, I am a Security Researcher with [@GuardianAudits](https://twitter.com/GuardianAudits).

I also compete in public contests on Sherlock, C4 and Cantina and secured top placings in multiple contests. My range of expertise includes restaking, defi lending/borrowing, NFT and DAO governance.

Previously, I was a Solidity developer at [@Steadefi](https://twitter.com/steadefi) where I built yield vaults which attracted >$2M in TVL. I have experience writing comprehensive test suites, fuzzing/invariant tests, and performing gas optimization.

I was also accepted into [@SpearbitDAO](https://twitter.com/SpearbitDAO) as a Junior Security Researcher.

Major highlights:
1. 3rd placing in Code4rena contest for Salty.io (Dex)
2. 3rd placing in Sherlock contest for Jojo Exchange (Perp protocol)
3. 4th placing in Sherlock contest for Real Wagmi (Defi trading, yield)
