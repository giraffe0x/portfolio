# About giraffe0x

I am a security researcher with [@GuardianAudits](https://twitter.com/GuardianAudits) doing Solidity Smart Contract audits. I am also a junior security researcher at [@SpearbitDAO](https://twitter.com/SpearbitDAO) and regularly compete on contest platforms.

Previously, I was a Solidity developer at [@Steadefi](https://twitter.com/steadefi) where I built yield vaults which attracted >$2M in TVL.
